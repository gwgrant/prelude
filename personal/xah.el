  "Copy the current buffer's file path or dired path to `kill-ring'.
Result is full path.
If `universal-argument' is called first, copy only the dir path.

If in dired, copy the file/dir cursor is on, or marked files.

If a buffer is not file and not dired, copy value of `default-directory' (which is usually the “current” dir when that buffer was created)
